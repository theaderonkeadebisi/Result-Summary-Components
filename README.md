## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS3 properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first 
- [Styled Components](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Hanken+Grotesk) - For styles


### What I learned

```html
<p><strong>92</strong>/100</p> 
I used strong for my scores instead of using the span element and assigning a class afterwards just to add an effect to a value like I would normally do.
```

### Continued development

I would like to be more intentional about implementing semantic HTML. I would also like to be more comfortable with CSS selectors.
I feel like I try not to use too many divs but i end up using too many divs. I don't know when it's unnecessary to use it.

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com) - This helped me when I had issues with remembering flex-box properties, linear-gradient and how to import the font-family.
